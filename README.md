# Portfolio Website

This is a simple portfolio website used to showcase some of projects, experience, and a way to connect with other peers, clients, and future employers.


## Description

This website employs basic CSS principles(grid) to set up the different sections(head, experience, footer). 
Links are set up to my personal socials.
The site is hosted through Github Pages.
