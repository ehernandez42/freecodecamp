# Portfolio Website v.1 - created 2022

(feb. 2024)
This was my first ever project using HTML and CSS, designing a website with different forms of information and links to my social media.
I used a template from W3schools as a reference. I recreated the layout using that as a guide.
I am proud to see where I started and I look forward to seeing what else I create!

This is a simple portfolio website used to showcase some of projects, experience, and a way to connect with other peers, clients, and future employers.


## Description

This website employs basic CSS principles(grid) to set up the different sections(head, experience, footer). 
Links are set up to my personal socials.
The site is hosted through Github Pages.
